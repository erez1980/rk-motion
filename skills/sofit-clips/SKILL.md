name: sofit-clips
description: Make captioned vertical (9:16) social clips from a Hebrew podcast episode (Weekly Sync) with sofit — suggest candidate moments, let the user pick, then render with speaker-tracking face crop, word-by-word Hebrew captions, and the Weekly Sync logo. Use when the user wants social clips / reels / shorts / TikToks from an episode. Part of the sofit tool (see /sofit for the full pipeline).

# sofit-clips

Episode → picked moments → captioned 9:16 clips. Suggest → user picks → render (never auto-render the whole pool).

## 0. Refresh the trend playbook — ONLY if stale

Short-form technique moves slowly (the 2026-07-25 pass found the best playbooks were
evergreen 2024-25 videos; the last-7-day layer was hiring posts and generic tips), so
this is a staleness check, not a per-episode ritual. Run it:

```bash
ls -l ~/Documents/Last30Days/short-form-video-hooks-retention-and-captions-raw-v3.md
```

- **Newer than ~30 days** → skip the research, apply the playbook below. Say one line:
  "playbook is N days old, skipping research."
- **Older than ~30 days, or missing** → run
  `/last30days short form video hooks retention and captions`, then update the playbook
  below with anything that actually CHANGED. Do not rewrite it to restate the same rules
  in new words — the point is catching a shift, not regenerating prose.

If the research contradicts a **code-enforced** rule below, that is a tool change (say so
and open it as work), not something to fix by hand at cut time.

## Current playbook (from /last30days, 2026-07-25)

Enforced in code — nothing to do at cut time, they happen automatically:
| Rule | Where |
|---|---|
| Clip opens ON the hook (no throat-clearing before it) | `generate.py` word-snap |
| 20-45s clip length | `resolve_clip_item` length bar |
| Caption-first hook card, first ~1.8s, auto-fit to 2 lines | `render.py` `_fit_hook_card` |
| Word-by-word karaoke captions, white + outline, lower-middle third | `render.py` |
| 2 alternate hooks per clip for A/B | `--hook-variant N` |

Needs judgment when picking from the pool — the tool can't decide these:
- **Prefer a curiosity gap**: an opener posing a question the clip hasn't answered yet.
  Hard numbers ("44% צועקים נציג") and contrarian claims ("זה בולשיט") both work.
- **Keep the visual layer plain.** Senior editors consistently say flashy transitions and
  VFX date fast; story and hard cuts win. Don't add motion for its own sake.
- **A/B the opener when a clip matters** rather than agonizing over one line — render 2
  variants and let the retention curve decide.

## 1. Candidate pool → user picks
```bash
"$PY" "$SKILL/clips.py" pool "<episode.mp4>"          # writes <episode>.pool.json + a numbered table
```
Present the table; ask which numbers to render. Build the spec from the picks:
```bash
"$PY" "$SKILL/clips.py" build "<episode.mp4>" "<episode>.pool.json" --pick 2,4,7
```

## 2. Render the picked clips (slow — background)
```bash
"$SOFIT" --render-from "<episode>.clips.json" --render-clips "<out_dir>" --logo "$LOGO"
```
- Crop-to-fill 9:16, speaker-tracking face crop, bold Hebrew word-highlight captions, logo top-left.
- Output `<out_dir>/clip-N.mp4` (ids match the pool numbers). Copy to ~/Downloads as `WS<episode>_clip-N.mp4`.
- Per-frame Pillow caption pass ⇒ seconds+ per clip; run in background.
- Set-once logo: `export SOFIT_LOGO="$LOGO"` (then `--logo` optional). `--logo-pos {top-left,top-right,bottom-left,bottom-right}`.
- Each clip opens with its `hook` burned large in the upper third for ~1.8s
  (caption-first hook for muted viewers, since most scroll on mute). Off with
  `--no-hook-card`; to change it, edit `hook` in the clips.json and re-render.
- A/B the opener: each clip carries `hook_variants` (2 alternates). Render one with
  `--hook-variant N` (1-based) — it writes `<id>.hookN.mp4` alongside the original.
- This `--render-from` path is the ONLY one that honors caption fixes (`/sofit-captions`); plain `--render-clips` regenerates from the transcript.

## 3. Log how they performed (closes the loop)
After posting, record the numbers — this is the ONLY step that turns priors into real
signal, and the data is perishable (unrecorded, which hook won is gone).
```bash
"$PY" "$SKILL/clips.py" log WS203 clip-5 "<the hook that was posted>" \
  --platform tiktok --views 12400 --retention 47
```
- `--retention` (percent watched) is the signal that matters; views are confounded by
  posting time and follower count. Log it when the platform gives it to you.
- Use `--variant N` when you posted an alternate hook, so A/B results stay attributable.
- Appends to `~/Documents/sofit-performance.jsonl` (outside the repo — it is public).
  Override with `SOFIT_PERF_LOG`.
- At **8+ rows** pool generation starts including the best/worst real hooks in its prompt
  and weighting them over research priors. Below that it stays silent on purpose — "what
  worked" over 3 posts is noise. Each `log` prints how many rows are still needed.

## Gotchas (learned the hard way)
- **Verify with a real rendered frame** — `ffmpeg -ss T -i clip.mp4 -frames:v 1 f.png` and look. Especially Hebrew RTL.
- **Face crop** needs the `crop` extra (opencv, installed); holds through rapid cuts (won't chase every camera cut); falls back to center if no face.
- **Two-person / wide shots**: only one person fits a 9:16 crop — set a clip's `focus` [0,1] in the clips.json to override.
- To fix a caption typo → `/sofit-captions`. To cut a moment out of a finished clip → `/sofit-trim`.
- Write the social copy in Navot's voice via `/nabot` (not here).
